- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dedaman
- I am Yohanes Pancaran, as a teacher. I think education is free for every individual, besides that everyone should know what he or she is studying for.
- To realize a more transparent education, it is necessary to involve all components of education such as teachers, parents and students.
- Therefore, it is important to create an integrated education system that can make this education a flexible, transparent and accountable communication medium.
